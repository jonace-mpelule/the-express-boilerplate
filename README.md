## Features
- **Express.js**: A fast and flexible Node.js web framework
- **Prisma**: A powerful ORM for PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in code
- **Prettier**: A code formatter that enforces a consistent coding style
- **Morgan**: A request logger middleware for logging HTTP requests
- **Helmet**: A security middleware that sets various HTTP headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
- **Cors**: A middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- **Rate Limiting**: A middleware that limits the number of requests from a single IP address
- **Error Handling**: A comprehensive error handling system that catches and logs errors

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- **src**: The source code directory
- **config**: Configuration files
- **loaders**: Loader functions for setting up the application
- **middleware**: Custom middleware functions
- **models**: Prisma models
- **prisma**: Prisma schema and client
- **resolvers**: Resolvers for Prisma models
- **routes**: Route handlers for the application
- **services**: Service classes for encapsulating business logic
- **types**: Type definitions for the application
- **tests**: The test directory
- **node_modules**: The directory for installed dependencies

## Installation
To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install

## Configuration
The project uses a `config` directory to store configuration files. The main configuration file is `index.ts`, which exports an object with the following properties:

- **port**: The port number to listen on
- **logs**: An object with logging configuration
- **prisma**: An object with Prisma configuration

## Database Setup
The project uses PostgreSQL as the database. To set up the database, create a new PostgreSQL database and add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

- **DATABASE_URL**: The URL of the PostgreSQL database
- **DATABASE_USERNAME**: The username for the PostgreSQL database
- **DATABASE_PASSWORD**: The password for the PostgreSQL database

## Prisma Schema
The project uses Prisma to define the database schema. The Prisma schema is defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

## Resolvers
The project uses resolvers to define the logic for interacting with the Prisma models. The resolvers are defined in the `resolvers` directory.

## Routes
The project uses route handlers to define the API endpoints. The route handlers are defined in the `routes` directory.

## Services
The project uses service classes to encapsulate business logic. The service classes are defined in the `services` directory.

## Middleware
The project uses middleware functions to modify the request or response. The middleware functions are defined in the `middleware` directory.

## Error Handling
The project uses a comprehensive error handling system that catches and logs errors. The error handling system is implemented using a combination of middleware functions and an error handler function.

## Logging
The project uses Morgan to log HTTP requests. The logging configuration is stored in the `config` directory.

## Security
The project uses Helmet to set various HTTP headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Testing
The project uses Jest to write unit tests and integration tests. The test directory is `tests`.

## Deployment
The project can be deployed to a production environment using a variety of methods, including:

- **Docker**: The project can be containerized using Docker and deployed to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.
- **Cloud Platforms**: The project can be deployed to a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud.
- **Serverless**: The project can be deployed to a serverless platform like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
